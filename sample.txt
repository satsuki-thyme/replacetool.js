Not Defeated by Rain (Author: Kenji Miyazawa, English translation: Gemini)

Not **defeated** by _rain_,
Nor by _wind_,
Nor by _snow_, nor by the summer _heat_.
With a **strong** _body_,
Free from _desires_,
Never angry,
Always smiling quietly.

Eating four cups of brown _rice_ a day,
With _miso_ and a few _vegetables_,
Observing, listening, and understanding
All things without _self-interest_,
And never forgetting.

Living in a **small thatched** _hut_
In the shade of the _pines_ in the _field_,
Going to the east to nurse a **sick** _child_,
Going to the west to **carry** the _sheaves_ of rice for a **tired** _mother_,
Going to the south to comfort a **dying** _person_,
Going to the north to stop a _quarrel_ or a _lawsuit_.

Weeping in times of _drought_,
Walking in confusion in the cold _summer_,
Called "Decuno-bo" by _everyone_,
Neither praised nor _blamed_,
Neither suffering nor _rejoicing_.

This is _what_ I want to be.
